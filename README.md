> **Decentralized compute on billions of devices with hardware trust**  
> Proof-of-Physical-Presence consensus + TEEs for 1000x cheaper cloud than AWS

## 🚀 What is MeshX?

MeshX transforms every device with a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) into a secure cloud compute node. We're building the world's largest decentralized compute network.

### Key Features

- **1000x Cheaper** than AWS/Azure/GCP
- **Hardware Security** via Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, Apple Secure Enclave
- **Novel Consensus** - Proof-of-Physical-Presence (PoP²)
- **Global Scale** - 7 continental shards + Starlink backbone
- **MESHX Tokens** - Earn by sharing idle compute

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Hardware Root of Trust** - TEEs ensure even device owners can't see your data
- **PoP² Consensus** - Combines VRF selection, latency proofs, and TEE attestation
- **Continental Sharding** - Process transactions locally, communicate globally
- **Encrypted Execution** - WASM-based sandboxed runtime

## 💰 Economics

**MeshX Token (MESHX)**
- Total Supply: 10,000,000,000 MESHX
- Earn by contributing compute resources
- Spend to execute jobs on the network
- Backed by real computational resources

## 🚦 Roadmap

- **Q1-Q2 2026**: Foundation & Private Testnet
- **Q3-Q4 2026**: Public Testnet + DePAIN Launch
- **Q1-Q2 2027**: Mainnet Beta
- **Q3-Q4 2027**: Full Mainnet + 1M Nodes
- **2028+**: 1B+ Device Mesh

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# Install MeshX node
curl -sSf https://meshx.network/install.sh | sh

# Start earning
